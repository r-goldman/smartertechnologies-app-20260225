## Project Structure

This project consists of 2 python scripts: [sort.py](./sort.py), and [test.py](./test.py).

- `sort.py` contains the implementation of the problem function (defined [here](https://thoughtfulautomation.notion.site/Core-Engineering-Technical-Screen-b61b6f6980714c198dc49b91dd23d695))
- `test.py` contains a helper script to execute the problem function with several different inputs. It asserts the return value of the problem function matches expectations.
